# Contributing to Overwatch

Any contribution you can make to Overwatch is very welcome.

Feel free to open a new issue on the [Github issue tracker](https://github.com/zsturgess/overwatch/issues) if you think you have found a bug, or wish to suggest an enhancement. Ensure your issue is correctly marked with the `bug` or `enhancement` label.

## Contributing a patch

For any changes you wish to make, you should create an issue on the issue tracker, detailing the problem and your intended fix. This allows everyone involved in the Overwatch project to discuss your intended fix and collaborate on the intended solution.

To get started on your patch, fork the [main overwatch repository](https://github.com/zsturgess/overwatch). Start a new branch for your work, avoid committing directly to the master branch, even on your own fork.

All commit messages should contain the issue number that is being worked towards. Overwatch uses Travis CI to run automated tests against pull requests, so commits that make no code changes, such as changes to documentation or comments should have [skip ci] in the commit message.

Once your patch is ready (including writing any tests or documentation, and checking the existing tests do not fail), submit a pull request on the main overwatch repository's master branch.
